The original idea for my project was to be a Top down 2D tower defence game, and it has kept this wholy in nature along development. Getting the project to a testable stage took a long time however, with the focus on ASP.NET it was some time before I could 100% commit to JavaScript and then after that, Unity. With my game being a dynamic web application, using MVC as the logic for my game would be counter productive. The game needs to update and play in real time, not in a client / server request relationship. MVC would still be used, but later for identity and for storing the users score to a scoreboard that would be stored in Azure. At the time of my writing this, this functionality is not implemented yet however. <br>

The game originally was to be written in JavaScript, but with more research and pressure to get a product ready, I went with Unity instead, and took alot of time to focus and learn how the engine works. <br>
