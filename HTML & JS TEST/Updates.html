                AlphaBuild 0.1
            </h3>
            <p>
                Very first stable build of the game. <br>
                Unfortunately, since tower targeting and other aspects are not 
                yet implemented, all you can do is lose! Sorry!<br>
                Items implemented:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One map.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implemented "tower spots". These are Set locations on the 
                        map where you can build your towers by clicking on them. Towers currently have
                        one variant and 3 upgrade levels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implemented one enemy. Named simply "enemy" has 100 hp, moves slowly, and takes 1hp from the core.
                        No animations.<br>
                        Plays sound on core hit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implemented circuit core. This acts as your health, if an enemy reaches this then the enemey will be 
                        destroyed but you will lose 1 hp.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added a music track. Credit to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dj-meizong/heartburn-original-mix">Meizong</a> for his song

            </h3>
            <p>
                After the game has been in slow development over the course of our
                Microsoft Software and Systems Academy, I finally have a build
                that is able to be hosted on WebGL.
